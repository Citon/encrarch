# Optional base to store copies of source files under.  Reasons to use:
#  1) To avoid having large files change durring processing - If your source
#     file(s) might change while encrarch is still enrcrypting, you need to
#     use this feature to avoid encrypting while the source is being updated
#  2) For an additional saved copy of the files being archived.  If the backup
#     job may corrupt the main backup file, or if you want to simply store
#     a copy in an alternate location.
